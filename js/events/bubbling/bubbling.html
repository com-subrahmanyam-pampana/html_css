<!-- 
1.When an event happens on an element, it first runs the 
handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up 
on other ancestors. 
2.The process is called “bubbling”, because events “bubble” 
from the inner element up through parents like a bubble 
in the water.
Some event are exception like focus event does not bubble
