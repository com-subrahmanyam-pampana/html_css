<!-- 
1.A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. 
Normally it goes upwards till <html>, and then to document
object, and some events even reach window, calling all 
handlers on the path.

2.But any handler may decide that the event has been fully 
processed and stop the bubbling.

3.The method for it is event.stopPropagation().
-->
<html>
    <body onclick="alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)">
        <button onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Click me</button>
      </body>
</html>
