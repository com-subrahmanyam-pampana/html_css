A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

    descendant selector (space)
    child selector (>)
    adjacent sibling selector (+)
    general sibling selector (~)
