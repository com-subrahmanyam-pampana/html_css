<!-- 
1.An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the 
nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative 
to the viewport, like fixed).

2.However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, 
and can overlap elements. -->
